1. As the owner, I want to be able to accept or reject songs into my Spotify playlist queue sent to me by requesters.

2. Repeat songs requests would be combined into one with request numbers too.

3. In order to see song requests, the user must have a balance greater than 0, in addition to having a verified account. Users can top off their account balance by going to the *My Account* tab.

4. The owner can then share the code with participants to add songs.

5. Once the owner recieves a request, they will have the option to either accept or reject.

6. If the owner accepts, then an API call will be crafted to add that song to the owner's Spotify queue.

7. If the owner rejects, then no API calls will be made.

8. The owner can clear the entire queue with a **clear all** button.

9. There is also an autoqueue button that automatically adds a song to the owner's queue without the need of the owner's approval.

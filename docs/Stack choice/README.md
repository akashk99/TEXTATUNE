The tech stack chosen is to use Node.js with express for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. The decision was made because we wanted to keep the entire project within one programming language, and using another language like Python with Django could complicate things. In addition, Node.js with npm has many webapp based packages that we would need. One other consideration that was thought was to use Rust with webasm for better performance, however that would add too much to development time.

Our app does not have a webform to make API calls since the nature of the business logic is to handle everything in the back end and allow end users to simply queue songs. Instead of a web form, we used a text messaging system to handle external API calls. However, the login and signup forms make internal API calls to the app server.

The decision behind choosing Vue.js is because two of our team members already have some experience with the framework, so choosing it would allow for an easier ramp up. Another framework we considered using is react and angular.js. However, because of our existing experience with Vue.js, we figured that we can produce a webapp with much higher quality using Vue.js than using react or angular.
